## Description
The permission token enables to provide and then verify access to a
resource. There is one token per accessed resource. Users can require, exchange
and later use tokens representing access to the resource.

This token can be configured to give 3 different types of permissions:
- unrestricted access to an unlimited resource:
  Reusable permission, like a door pass, an admin right, etc...
- restricted access to an unlimited resource:
  Make 3 wishes, use 100 times an API for free, etc...
- restricted access to a limited resource:
  Eat 2 cookies, Get 4 seats at a concert, etc...

The type influences the side effect at the moment the token is used only.
