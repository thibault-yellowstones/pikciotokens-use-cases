## Description
The shares token helps to maintain a registry of shareholders, along with
the rights associated to their weight.

Those rights are driven by the vote policy, which can be "One dollar one vote"
or "One person one vote".

This token allows shareholders to delegate their power to other shareholders
using allowances, making a difference between "organic" shares/weight and
actual one.
