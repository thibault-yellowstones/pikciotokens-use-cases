# Equity Tokens
Equity tokens are a subcategory of security tokens that represent ownership of an asset, such as debt or company stock. By employing blockchain technology and smart contracts, a startup could forgo a traditional initial public offering (IPO) and instead issue shares and voting rights over the blockchain. Additionally, a lender could create tokens that represent debt owned by the company, enabling loans to be bought and sold in a high-liquidity environment.

Many people believe that equity tokens will eventually become the predominant type of ICO token. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indicated that equity tokens are subject to federal securities regulations, and as of the time of writing, few startups are equipped with the resources to issue equity tokens that comply with all applicable regulations. Consequently, investors should not contribute to an equity token ICO without obtaining guidance from a legal professional who specializes in federal securities law.
