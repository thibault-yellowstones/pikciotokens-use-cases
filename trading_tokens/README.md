## Description
In the PikcioRealms world, each token describes a card that is part of a
trading card game.

Characteristics are set once for all just after the token creation. Each card
then has its own supply and characteristic embedded in the token.

The cards can be exchanged in order to create powerful combinations, depending
on the actual rules of this fictive trading card game.

This kind of token is particular, as it represents only a part of a greater
system involving several tokens.

## Characteristics

This token has following properties.

### Decimals
A card is atomic and cannot be split. Thus, it has no decimals.

### Roles
The token creator is called the **craftsman**.

The craftsman is the only one that can mint new cards.
Each other account is a normal one and does not any hold special permission.

### Supply management

In the context of a trading card with special effects, the rarity of the card is
a deterministic factor.

In this version of a trading card, only the craftsman can
issue new units of the cards. However, any player can tear a card he/she
owns, making it possible to increase the rarity of a card by buying units in 
order to destroy them.

### Transfer conditions
No specific restrictions on transfer.

### Allowances conditions
No specific restrictions on allowances.

### Others
As said above, this card token should be orchestrated with others
of the same kind to create enough cards to make the whole game.

The game itself could then be a smart contract interacting with all the tokens.
In this kind of game, it could be interesting to let people create and trade
their own cards, probably by first defining limits on the characteristics they could
hold.
