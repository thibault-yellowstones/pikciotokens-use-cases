## Description
In the PikcioRealms world, each token describes a card that is part of a
trading card game.

Characteristics are set once for all just after the token creation. Each card
then has its own supply and characteristic embedded in the token.

The cards can be exchanged in order to create powerful combinations, depending
on the actual rules of this fictive trading card game.

This kind of token is particular, as it represents only a part of a greater
system involving several tokens.
