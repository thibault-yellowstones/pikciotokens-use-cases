"""The vote token allows to create poll on people or topics.

Before starting the vote, the vote place (token creator) defines a list of
candidates.

Once the vote is started, everyone except the candidate and the vote place
receives one and only one token.

Afterwards, people send their token to the candidate they like the most.
The vote is stopped when everyone has voted or when the vote place decides to
interrupt the vote.

Once the vote is stopped, everyone can see results, like the winner and the
participation.
